    "In order to be ready for real world applications of probability, it is important to understand what happens when probabilities are not independent. Very often, the probability of a certain event depends on other events happening! Let's see how this all works in this lab.\n",

    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and explain the conditional probability - $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B) P(B)$\n",
    "- Use the multiplication rule to find the probability of the intersection of two events\n",
    "- Apply the techniques learned in the lesson to simple problems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "A coin is tossed and a single 6-sided dice is rolled. Find the probability of landing on the head side of the coin and rolling a 3 on the dice."
